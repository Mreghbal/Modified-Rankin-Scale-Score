## Introduction
 Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) a scale that measures the degree of disability or dependence in individuals who have experienced a stroke or other neurological conditions. It is commonly used in clinical research and practice to assess the functional outcome of patients.

The mRS consists of seven levels, ranging from 0 to 6, each representing a different level of disability. The scale helps healthcare professionals and researchers evaluate the impact of a condition a patient's ability carry out daily activities and make informed decisions about their care.

## Usage
To use the mRS score calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `calculate_mrs_score.py` file2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `calculate_mrs_score.py` file is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:
   ```
   python calculate_mrs_score.py
   ```
5. Enter the disability level when prompted. The program will display the corresponding mRS score description.

## Understanding the Code
The `calculate_mrs_score` function takes a single parameter, `disability_level`, which represents the level disability on the Modified Rankin Scale. The function uses a series of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to map the provided `disability_level` to its corresponding mRS score description.

The function returns the mRS score description as a string. If the `disability_level` does not match any of the predefined levels, the function will return an appropriate error message.

## Examples
Here are some examples demonstrate how the code works:

```python
# Example 1
disability_level = 3
result = calculate_mrs_score(disability_level)
print(f"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score: {result}")
```
Output:
```
Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score: Moderate disability, requiring some help but able to walk without assistance
```

```python
# Example 2
disability_level = 0
result = calculate_mrs_score(disability_level)
print(f"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score: {result}")
```
Output:
```
Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score: symptoms at all
```

## Conclusion
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score calculator provides a simple and efficient way to determine the level of disability or dependence in individuals who have experienced a stroke or other neurological conditions. By using this tool, healthcare professionals and researchers can assess the functional outcome of patients and make informed decisions about their care.
